# Hello I'm Verito!

Hi! 😁 I'm Veronica, eighth semester student of Systems Engineering, mainly this was not the career I wanted to study, but I have learned many things that have made the systems become part of my life; here I leave you some things I've been able to learn from them: 

 - 🤓 I am very good when I put my mind to it.
 - 📚 I like to learn by myself.

on the other hand, this is a little bit of my professional profile, it is still in the process of being the best I have ever seen, but it is the fruit of my perseverance as a student: [mi perfil profesional](Hi!%20%F0%9F%98%81%20I%27m%20Veronica,%20eighth%20semester%20student%20of%20Systems%20Engineering,%20mainly%20this%20was%20not%20the%20career%20I%20wanted%20to%20study,%20but%20I%20have%20learned%20many%20things%20that%20have%20made%20the%20systems%20become%20part%20of%20my%20life;%20here%20I%20leave%20you%20some%20things%20what%20I%20have%20been%20able%20to%20learn%20about%20me%20in%20this%20time%20of%20study:%20%20%20%F0%9F%A4%93%20I%20am%20very%20good%20when%20I%20put%20my%20mind%20to%20it.%20%F0%9F%93%9A%20I%20like%20to%20learn%20by%20myself.%20%20%20on%20the%20other%20hand,%20this%20is%20a%20little%20bit%20of%20my%20professional%20profile,%20it%20is%20still%20in%20the%20process%20of%20being%20the%20best%20I%20have%20ever%20seen,%20but%20it%20is%20the%20fruit%20of%20my%20perseverance%20as%20a%20student.%20%20%20%20Translated%20with%20www.DeepL.com/Translator%20%28free%20version%29)
