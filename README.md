# Hello I'm Verito!

Hi! 😁 I'm Veronica, eighth semester student of Systems Engineering, mainly this was not the career I wanted to study, but I have learned many things that have made the systems become part of my life; here I leave you some things I've been able to learn from them: 

 - 🤓 I am very good when I put my mind to it.
 - 📚 I like to learn by myself.

on the other hand, this is a little bit of my professional profile, it is still in the process of being the best I have ever seen, but it is the fruit of my perseverance as a [student](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-botero-garcia-a9b963246):
